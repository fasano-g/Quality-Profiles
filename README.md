This repository contains materials and files related to Quality Profiles and Test Set Profiles, which have been introduced by Giovanni Fasano, Christian Piermarini and Massimo Roma 
in 2025. Quality Profiles are able to benchmarking solvers for optimization problems, with specific attention to the accuracy of the solution found by the solvers 
on the given test set. On the other hand, Test Set Profiles provide a measure to evaluate the consistency of a test set for the chosen solvers to be compared. Both Quality Profiles and Test Set Profiles can be applied for the comparison of either exact or heuristic solvers, as well as for solvers adopted in smooth and derivative-free optimization frameworks.
