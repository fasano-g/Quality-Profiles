This repository contains materials and files related to Quality Profiles, which have been introduced by Giovanni Fasano, Christian Piermarini and Massimo Roma 
in 2025. Quality Profiles are able to benchmarking solvers for optimization problems, with specific attention to the accuracy of the solution found by solvers 
on given test sets. Quality Profiles apply to both exact and heuristic solvers, as well as to solvers for smooth and derivative-free optimization.
